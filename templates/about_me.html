        Hello, this is Tokom. Economics and econometrics are my areas of study. A Harvard University (CS50) certified
        programmer and self-taught software developer, I also have a background in computer science.
        I have always been curious about technology (particularly computer science). Thanks to CS50, I have been able to
        learn Computer Science in a fun and challenging way.
        Currently, I am learning discrete math, mathematical economics and mathematical thinking in computer science to
        improve my knowledge of computer science and economics.
        Besides learning, I also develop web and mobile apps for various clients from the public sector to the private
        sector.
        One day, I want to develop useful tools to help societies around the world by combining my skills in economics,
        mathematics and computer science.
        You can contact me if you think I can help you along the way.
        Here is a <a href="/contact">link</a> to my contact page.
        <div class="thankyou">
